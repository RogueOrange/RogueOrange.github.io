# Gareth Coward Portfolio

A single-page, dark themed portfolio for Gareth Coward with a full-screen landing intro, rotating focus words, and a project catalog powered by client-side filtering.

## Structure
- `index.html` — page structure and content sections (intro, hero, about, projects, process, notes, contact).
- `assets/css/style.css` — theme, layout, and animation styles.
- `assets/js/main.js` — rotating headline words and interactive project filtering/search.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build steps or external tooling are required.

## Customization
- Update copy and section titles directly in `index.html`.
- Adjust colors, spacing, or animation timing in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Add or edit project entries in `assets/js/main.js` under the `projects` array.
